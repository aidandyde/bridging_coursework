# Bridging Coursework (Year 1)
Due to the cancellation of the May 2020 Exam season due to Coronavirus, the School of Computer Science asked us to complete this piece of coursework - on creating a simple website
using the Django framework - to ensure progression to the second year of the degree. <br>
This is my entry, having followed the instructions provided to create a very basic blog website. <br>
The site was eventually hosted at PythonAnywhere.com
## Areas for future improvement:
Although outside of the specification of the task, there are a number of ways the project could be improved and expanded. This includes adding user authentication and improving
the CSS styling, which I'll admit isn't the best currently.
